    <h1>Roadline</h1>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Access to the professional transport market.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Roadline connects experienced drivers and transport companies in Europe
      through direct access, verification and professional standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>
      Roadline connects professionals, not profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that the transport market works best
      when drivers and carriers communicate directly,
      expectations are clear, and experience is valued over numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to restore professional trust
      through access, verification and respect on both sides.
    </p>

    <h2>For drivers</h2>
    <p>
      Roadline is for experienced professionals
      looking for transparent cooperation with serious carriers —
      without agencies, spam or mass recruitment.
    </p>

    <h2>For transport companies</h2>
    <p>
      Roadline provides direct access to verified drivers
      who value responsibility, schedules and long-term cooperation.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes Roadline different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No job boards</li>
      <li>No agencies</li>
      <li>No mass flow</li>
      <li>No empty promises</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only direct access, professional standards and real experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Project status</h2>
    <p>
      Roadline is at an early stage.
      The platform is forming its first professional network
      and establishing direct contacts with drivers and carriers.
